This project is a Flask-based AI-powered resume analysis tool that helps both job seekers (students) and interviewers analyze resumes using LLM (Large Language Model) processing. It enables users to upload resumes in PDF or DOCX format, extracts text from them, and generates insights using an LLM API (e.g., Groq's OpenAI-compatible API).
